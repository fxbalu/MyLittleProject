{"name":"My Little Project","tagline":"A 2D sprite based platformer game","body":"# My Little Project\r\n\r\nMy Little Project is game developped by five engineering students from __INSA de Rennes__ in France. It's a 2D sprite based platformer.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add screenshots\r\n- [ ] Create a simple Makefile\r\n- [ ] Rewrite the project with SDL2\r\n- [x] Stop deleting useful files (hopefully)\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu\r\n\r\n1. Install ```libsdl1.2-dev```, ```libsdl-image1.2-dev```, ```libsdl-mixer1.2-dev``` and ```libsdl-ttf2.0-dev``` on your system.\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev\r\n```\r\n2. Clone the repository.\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/fxbalu/MyLittleProject\r\n```\r\n3. Create a new SDL project with Code::Blocks.\r\n4. Add the ```src``` folder to your Code::Blocks project.\r\n5. Add ```SDL```, ```SDLmain```, ```SDL_image```, ```SDL_mixer``` and ```SDL_ttf``` in __Project > Build options... > Linker settings > Link libraries__\r\n6. Build and run the project (```F9```).\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\n### Syntax\r\n- Indent your code with three space, and no tab\r\n- No trailing whitespace. Blank lines should not have any space.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nUse Doxygen syntax to comment your files, structures and functions.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```c\r\n/**\r\n *  \\brief Print arguments in standard output\r\n *  \\param arg1       First argument\r\n *  \\param bar        Second argument\r\n *  \\param character  Starting character\r\n */\r\nvoid foo(int arg1, int bar, char character){\r\n  // some code\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\n\r\n- Vincent Werner\r\n- Gwendal Henry\r\n- Martin Parisot\r\n- ~~Adrian Dufac~~ (still need to commit something)\r\n- Fran√ßois-Xavier Balu\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
